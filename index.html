<h2>PERSONAL INTERESTS</h2>
<p>In my free time I enjoy adventures with my son, completing complicated knitting projects, cruising around on my bike, RVing, binging on Netflix and over-priced cheese, and ferreting out tasty soup recipes on the internet. I'm interested in urban design, tiny houses, reducing my carbon footprint, and living to be 100. </p>
