<h2>PERSONAL INTERESTS</h2>
<p>In my free time I enjoy adventures with my son, completing complicated knitting projects, cruising around on my bike, and ferreting out tasty soup recipes on the internet. I'm interested in urban design, tiny houses, reducing my carbon footprint, and living to be 100. Oh, and learning. Always learning.</p>

<h3>PROFILE</h3> 
<p>
My interest in technology and the way we integrate it into our lives was the catalyst for completing my Technical Communication BA and re-focusing my career path. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things. I'm currently working on my MS, Technical Communication, and then who knows, maybe a Ph.D. Change and growth are my only constant.
